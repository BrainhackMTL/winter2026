        ## Guidelines

        We are very excited to meet you at Brainhack Montreal 2026 🎉.

        To submit a project:

        - make sure you have read our **[Guidelines for Leading and Attending to Brainhack Projects](https://github.com/brainhackorg/bhg-event-materials/blob/master/docs/leading_and_attending_to_brainhack_projects.md)** to increase the diversity and inclusivity of your project work

        - fill in all the required items (marked with a red asterisk `*`) in the form below. Note that if you are missing some information but still want to submit a project, you can always input dummy content.

        - click on `Submit new issue` at the bottom of the form

        After the issue is submitted, we will assign a `project monitor` to review your submission.

        After approval we will add the label `status:web_ready`.

        Note that you can always update your issue after clicking on `Submit new issue`. 
        If at any time you need help from us or anything is unclear, please message us on Discord (`https://discord.gg/AEXF3kQ9Wf`). Our team is here to help!
