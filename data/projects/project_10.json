  "Project Description": "<p><a href=\"https://nipoppy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">Nipoppy</a> is a lightweight framework for standardized organization and processing of neuroimaging-clinical datasets. Its goal is to help users adopt the <a href=\"https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/\">FAIR</a> principles and improve the reproducibility of studies.</p>\n<p>This brainhack project aims to add a visual quality control (QC) interface to the Nipoppy framework. We will build a prototype using <a href=\"https://streamlit.io/\">Streamlit</a> and <a href=\"https://niivue.com/\">Niivue</a> tools. The QC interface would show both 2D image report (.svg) and 3D nifti files. We will test this prototype on <code>raw</code> and <code>processed</code> images from fmriprep pipeline using a <a href=\"https://github.com/nipoppy/tutorial-dataset\">sample Nipoppy dataset</a>.</p>\n<p>MRI quality checks are hard! We would like to make them a bit easier :)</p>\n",
