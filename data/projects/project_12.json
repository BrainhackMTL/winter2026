  "Goals for Brainhack Montreal": "<p>We hope to design a basic prototype of a MCP for querying a Nipoppy dataset. The goal is to begin designing the API for searching the dataset and have a deployable service for a dataset to deploy to use the service.</p>\n",
  "Skills": "<ul>\n<li>Python - intermediate</li>\n<li>API / MCP experience</li>\n<li>LLM Agents</li>\n</ul>\n",

  "Onboarding documentation / Expectations": null,
  "What will participants learn?": "<p>You will learn about how Nipoppy works internally with tracking data and analyses as well as the basics of MCP.</p>\n",
  "Data to use": "<p>We'll generate local examples of valid datasets to work with.</p>\n",
